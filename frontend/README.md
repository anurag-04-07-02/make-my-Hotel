Welcome to makeMyHotel.

It is a MERN Stack Hotel Booking App where users can reserve a hotel by selecting their destination, giving the date range of their stay and by selecting the number of rooms they want.

TechStack used : MongoDB, ExpressJs, NodeJs, ReactJS

I have used CSS for styling the website.

To run the code, you can clone my github repo.

To, run the server, move to the backend directory by using the command "cd backend" and then "npm start"

To, run the frontend, move to the frontend directory by using the command "cd frontend" and then "npm start".

Hope you like it. â˜º
